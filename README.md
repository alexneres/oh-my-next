# Oh My Next
Oh My Next is my go-to template for building new Next.js 13 applications. As a developer, I've found that having a reliable and customizable starting point is crucial for efficient and consistent web development.

## Getting Started


1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/oh-my-next.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory.

```bash
cd oh-my-next
```

3. Install the dependencies.

```bash
bun run dev
```
*You don't have or know what Bun is? you can take look at https://bun.sh/

4. Open your browser and access the development server at http://localhost:3000. You can start building your Next.js application right away.

## Tools
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/)

Bun is an all-in-one JavaScript runtime & toolkit designed for speed, complete with a bundler, test runner, and Node.js-compatible package manager.

- [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky#readme)

Husky ensures that code quality and formatting standards are maintained throughout the development process by running hooks before specific Git actions.

- [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged)

Lint Staged optimizes the linting process by checking only the files that are staged for commit. This significantly speeds up the development workflow and prevents unnecessary linting checks.

- [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) + [ESLint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint)

Prettier and ESLint work in tandem to enforce code style consistency and automatically format code. This combination saves time, eliminates debates over code formatting, and ensures a uniform codebase.

- [Commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint)

Commitlint enforces conventional commit messages, making it easier to track changes, understand their purpose, and automate tasks like versioning and changelog generation.

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

TypeScript enhances code quality by introducing static typing, catching errors during development, and providing better code intelligence in IDEs. It also improves code documentation and helps identify potential issues early in the development process.

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that speeds up the styling process, offers consistent design patterns, and facilitates rapid prototyping. It's highly customizable and allows for the creation of responsive and visually appealing user interfaces with minimal effort.
